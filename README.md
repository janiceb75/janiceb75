## Hello Friends, My Name is Janice.  ðŸ¤—


#### - About Me  ðŸ¤“ ðŸ˜…

I am an IT professional who enjoys creating. As a result, my career path has led me to a current transition into the path of Software Development. This is a journey that is introducing me to, and getting me comfortable with several technologies that were not a part of
my daily routine as Cyber Security professional. In addition to mastering these new skillsets, I also enjoy spending time with family, creating music, and spending time in nature.

#### - What I Am Currently Learning    ðŸ–¥

* Golang
* CI/CD practices
* Much more to come!
